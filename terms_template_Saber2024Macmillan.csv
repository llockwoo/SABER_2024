Promoter,"Definition: In cell biology, a promoter is a specific DNA sequence located near the start of a gene that serves as a binding site for RNA polymerase and other transcription factors. The promoter is essential for initiating the process of transcription, where the DNA sequence of a gene is copied into messenger RNA (mRNA). Promoters contain specific sequences, such as the TATA box in eukaryotes, that are recognized by these proteins to ensure that transcription starts at the correct location and time."
Mediator,"Definition: the Mediator is a large multiprotein complex that functions as a critical coactivator in the regulation of gene transcription. It acts as an intermediary between transcription factors bound to enhancers or promoters and RNA polymerase II, the enzyme responsible for synthesizing messenger RNA (mRNA) from DNA templates.

The Mediator complex facilitates the assembly of the pre-initiation complex at the promoter region of genes, thereby enhancing the efficiency and specificity of transcription initiation. It plays a crucial role in integrating and conveying regulatory signals from various transcription factors to RNA polymerase II, ensuring that genes are expressed at appropriate levels in response to cellular and environmental cues."
